What is Bootstrap?
•	Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development
•	Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins
•	Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs

Why Use Bootstrap?
•	Easy to use: Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using Bootstrap
•	Responsive features: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops
•	Mobile-first approach: In Bootstrap, mobile-first styles are part of the core framework
•	Browser compatibility: Bootstrap 4 is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer 10+, Edge, Safari, and Opera)
There are two ways to start using Bootstrap 4 on your own web site.

1.	Include Bootstrap 4 from a CDN
◦	If you don't want to download and host Bootstrap 4 yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).
◦	MaxCDN provides CDN support for Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript. You must also include jQuery:

<!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">
<!-- jQuery library -->
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<!-- Popper JS -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.16.0/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
<!-- Latest compiled JavaScript -->
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

One advantage of using the Bootstrap 4 CDN:
Many users already have downloaded Bootstrap 4 from MaxCDN when visiting another site. As a result, it will be loaded from cache when
they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time. Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, 
it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.

jQuery and Popper?
Bootstrap 4 use jQuery and Popper.js for JavaScript components (like modals, tooltips, popovers etc).
However, if you just use the CSS part of Bootstrap, you don't need them.

1.	Download Bootstrap 4 from getbootstrap.com
	If you want to download and host Bootstrap 4 yourself, go to https://getbootstrap.com/, and 	follow the instructions there.
	Command: npm install bootstrap

Create First Web Page With Bootstrap 4
1. Add the HTML5 doctype
	Always include the HTML5 doctype at the beginning of the page, along with the lang 	attribute and the correct character set:
		<!DOCTYPE html>



2. Bootstrap 4 is mobile-first
Bootstrap 4 is designed to be responsive to mobile devices. Mobile-first styles are part of the core framework.
To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, add the following <meta> tag inside the <head> element:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
The initial-scale=1 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
3. Containers

Bootstrap 4 also requires a containing element to wrap site contents.
There are two container classes to choose from:
1.	The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container
2.	The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport
