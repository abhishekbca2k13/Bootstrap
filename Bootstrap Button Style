Bootstrap Button Style:
Bootstrap 4 provides different styles of buttons:to implement it we can add the fowwlowing classes .btn, .btn-primery
The button classes can be used on <a>, <button>, or <input> elements:
Why do we put a # in the href attribute of the link?
Since we do not have any page to link it to, and we do not want to get a "404" message, we put # as the link. In real life it should of 
course been a real URL to the "Search" page

Button Outline
Bootstrap 4 provides eight outline/bordered buttons: classes are .btn-outline-primary

Button Sizes
Use the .btn-lg class for large buttons or .btn-sm class for small buttons:

Block Level Buttons
Add class .btn-block to create a block level button that spans the entire width of the parent element.

Active/Disabled Buttons
A button can be set to an active (appear pressed) or a disabled (unclickable) state:

Bootstrap Button Group:
Bootstrap 4 allows you to group a series of buttons together (on a single line) in a button group: by using .btn-group class.
Tip: Instead of applying button sizes to every button in a group, use class .btn-group-lg for a large button group or the .btn-group-sm for a small button group

Vertical Buttons
Bootstrap 4 also supports vertical button groups: apply .btn-group-vertical class to implement it.

Split Button Dropdowns
This is used to add button in dropdown.i.e.
<div class="btn-group">
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Sony</button>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle dropdown-toggle-split" data-	toggle="dropdown">
    <span class="caret"></span>
  </button>
  <div class="dropdown-menu">
    <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Tablet</a>
