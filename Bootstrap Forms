Bootstrap Forms:
Bootstrap 4's Default Settings
Form controls automatically receive some global styling with Bootstrap:

All textual <input>, <textarea>, and <select> elements with class .form-control have a width of 100%.
Bootstrap 4 Form Layouts
Bootstrap provides two types of form layouts:

Stacked (full-width) form
Add a wrapper element with .form-group, around each form control, to ensure proper margins:


Inline form
Add class .form-inline to the <form> element

Inline Form with Utilities
The inline form above feels "compressed", and will look much better with Bootstrap's spacing utilities. The following example adds 
a right margin (.mr-sm-2) to each input on all devices (small and up). And a margin bottom class (.mb-2) is used to style the input 
field when it breaks (goes from horizontal to vertical due to not enough space/width):

Form Row/Grid
You can also use columns (.col) to control the width and alignment of form inputs without using spacing utilities. Just remember to 
put them inside a .row container.
If you want less grid margins (override default column gutters), use .form-row instead of .row:

Form Validation
You can use different validation classes to provide valuable feedback to users. Add either .was-validated or .needs-validation to the
<form> element, depending on whether you want to provide validation feedback before or after submitting the form. The input fields will
have a green (valid) or red (invalid) border to indicate what's missing in the form. You can also add a .valid-feedback or 
.invalid-feedback message to tell the user explicitly what's missing, or needs to be done before submitting the form.
