Bootstrap Spinners:
To create a spinner/loader, use the .spinner-border class:
Use any text color utilites to add a color to the spinner: like .text-primary.

Growing Spinners
Use the .spinner-grow class if you want the spinner/loader to grow instead of "spin":

Spinner Size
Use .spinner-border-sm or .spinner-grow-sm to create a smaller spinner:

Spinner Buttons
You can also add spinners to a button, with or without text:
	<button class="btn btn-primary">
		  <span class="spinner-border spinner-border-sm"></span>
	</button>
