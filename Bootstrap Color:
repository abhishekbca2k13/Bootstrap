Bootstrap Color:

Text Colors
Bootstrap 4 has some contextual classes that can be used to provide "meaning through colors".

The classes for text colors are: .text-muted, .text-primary, .text-success, .text-info, .text-warning, .text-danger, .text-secondary,
.text-white, .text-dark, .text-body (default body color/often black) and .text-light:

Background Colors
The classes for background colors are: .bg-primary, .bg-success, .bg-info, .bg-warning, .bg-danger, .bg-secondary, .bg-dark and
.bg-light.

Note that background colors do not set the text color, so in some cases you'll want to use them together with a .text-* class.
