Bootstrap Toast:
The toast component is like an alert box that is only shown for a couple of seconds when something happens 
(i.e. when the user clicks on a button, submits a form, etc.).

How To Create a Toast
To create a toast, use the .toast class, and add a .toast-header and a .toast-body inside of it:
<div class="toast">
  <div class="toast-header">
    Toast Header
  </div>
  <div class="toast-body">
    Some text inside the toast body
  </div>
</div>

Note: Toasts must be initialized with jQuery: select the specified element and call the toast() method.

Show and Hide a Toast
Toasts are hidden by default. Use the data-autohide="false" attribute to show it by default. 
To close it, use a <button> element and add data-dismiss="toast":

Bootstrap Scrollspy:
Scrollspy is used to automatically update links in a navigation list based on scroll position.

Example
<!-- The scrollable area -->
<body data-spy="scroll" data-target=".navbar" data-offset="50">
<!-- The navbar - The <a> elements are used to jump to a section in the scrollable area -->
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-sm bg-dark navbar-dark fixed-top">
  <ul class="navbar-nav">
    <li><a href="#section1">Section 1</a></li>
    ...
</nav>
<!-- Section 1 -->
<div id="section1">
  <h1>Section 1</h1>
  <p>Try to scroll this page and look at the navigation bar while scrolling!</p>
</div>
...
</body>

Example Explained
Add data-spy="scroll" to the element that should be used as the scrollable area (often this is the <body> element).

Then add the data-target attribute with a value of the id or the class name of the navigation bar (.navbar). 
This is to make sure that the navbar is connected with the scrollable area.

Note that scrollable elements must match the ID of the links inside the navbar's list items (<div id="section1"> matches
<a href="#section1">).

The optional data-offset attribute specifies the number of pixels to offset from top when calculating the position of scroll. 
This is useful when you feel that the links inside the navbar changes the active state too soon or too early when jumping to the
scrollable elements. Default is 10 pixels.

Requires relative positioning: The element with data-spy="scroll" requires the CSS position property, with a value of "relative" 
to work properly.
