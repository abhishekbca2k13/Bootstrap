Bootstrap Navs:
Nav Menus
If you want to create a simple horizontal menu, add the .nav class to a <ul> element, followed by .nav-item for each <li> and add the.
nav-link class to their links:

Aligned Nav
Add the .justify-content-center class to center the nav, and the .justify-content-end class to right-align the nav.

Vertical Nav
Add the .flex-column class to create a vertical nav:

Tabs
Turn the nav menu into navigation tabs with the .nav-tabs class. Add the .active class to the active/current link. 
If you want the tabs to be togglable, see the last example on this page.

Pills
Turn the nav menu into navigation pills with the .nav-pills class. If you want the pills to be togglable, see the last example on this
page.

Justified Tabs/pills
Justify the tabs/pills with the .nav-justified class (equal width):

Toggleable / Dynamic Tabs
To make the tabs toggleable, add the data-toggle="tab" attribute to each link. Then add a .tab-pane class with a unique ID for every 
tab and wrap them inside a <div> element with class .tab-content.
If you want the tabs to fade in and out when clicking on them, add the .fade class to .tab-pane

Toggleable / Dynamic Pills
The same code applies to pills; only change the data-toggle attribute to data-toggle="pill":

Bootstrap Navbar:
A navigation bar is a navigation header that is placed at the top of the page:
Basic Navbar
With Bootstrap, a navigation bar can extend or collapse, depending on the screen size.

A standard navigation bar is created with the .navbar class, followed by a responsive collapsing class: .navbar-expand-xl|lg|md|sm
(stacks the navbar vertically on extra large, large, medium or small screens).

To add links inside the navbar, use a <ul> element with class="navbar-nav". Then add <li> elements with a .nav-item class followed by 
an <a> element with a .nav-link class:

Vertical Navbar
Remove the .navbar-expand-xl|lg|md|sm class to create a vertical navigation bar:

Centered Navbar
Add the .justify-content-center class to center the navigation bar.

The following example will center the navigation bar on medium, large and extra large screens. On small screens it will be displayed 
vertically and left-aligned (because of the .navbar-expand-sm class):

Colored Navbar
Use any of the .bg-color classes to change the background color of the navbar (.bg-primary, .bg-success, .bg-info, .bg-warning, 
.bg-danger, .bg-secondary, .bg-dark and .bg-light)

Tip: Add a white text color to all links in the navbar with the .navbar-dark class, or use the .navbar-light class to add a black text 
color.
Active/disabled state: Add the .active class to an <a> element to highlight the current link, or the .disabled class to indicate that 
the link is un-clickable.

Brand / Logo
The .navbar-brand class is used to highlight the brand/logo/project name of your page:
When using the .navbar-brand class on images, Bootstrap 4 will automatically style the image to fit the navbar vertically.

Collapsing The Navigation Bar
Very often, especially on small screens, you want to hide the navigation links and replace them with a button that should reveal them 
when clicked on.

To create a collapsible navigation bar, use a button with class="navbar-toggler", data-toggle="collapse" and data-target="#thetarget". 
Then wrap the navbar content (links, etc) inside a div element with class="collapse navbar-collapse", followed by an id that matches 
the data-target of the button: "thetarget".
Tip: You can also remove the .navbar-expand-md class to ALWAYS hide navbar links and display the toggler button.

Navbar Forms and Buttons
Add a <form> element with class="form-inline" to group inputs and buttons side-by-side:
You can also use other input classes, such as .input-group-prepend or .input-group-append to attach an icon or help text next to the 
input field.

Navbar Text
Use the .navbar-text class to vertical align any elements inside the navbar that are not links (ensures proper padding and text color).

Fixed Navigation Bar
The navigation bar can also be fixed at the top or at the bottom of the page.

A fixed navigation bar stays visible in a fixed position (top or bottom) independent of the page scroll.

The .fixed-top class makes the navigation bar fixed at the top:
Use the .sticky-top class to make the navbar fixed/stay at the top of the page when you scroll past it.
Note: This class does not work in IE11 and earlier (will treat it as position:relative).
