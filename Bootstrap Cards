Bootstrap Cards:
A card in Bootstrap 4 is a bordered box with some padding around its content. It includes options for headers, footers, content, 
colors, etc.

Basic Card
A basic card is created with the .card class, and content inside the card has a .card-body class:
If you are familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards replace old panels, wells, and thumbnails.
The .card-header class adds a heading to the card and the .card-footer class adds a footer to the card:

Contextual Cards
To add a background color the card, use contextual classes (.bg-primary, .bg-success, .bg-info, .bg-warning, .bg-danger, .bg-secondary,
.bg-dark and .bg-light

Titles, text, and links
Use .card-title to add card titles to any heading element. The .card-text class is used to remove bottom margins for a <p> element if 
it is the last child (or the only one) inside .card-body. The .card-link class adds a blue color to any link, and a hover effect.
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h4 class="card-title">Card title</h4>
    <p class="card-text">Some example text. Some example text.</p>
    <a href="#" class="card-link">Card link</a>
    <a href="#" class="card-link">Another link</a>
  </div>
</div>

Card Image
Add .card-img-top or .card-img-bottom to an <img> to place the image at the top or at the bottom inside the card. Note that we have 
added the image outside of the .card-body to span the entire width:

Stretched Link
Add the .stretched-link class to a link inside the card, and it will make the whole card clickable and hoverable (the card will act as a link):
	<a href="#" class="btn btn-primary stretched-link">See Profile</a>

Casrd Image Overlays
Turn an image into a card background and use .card-img-overlay to add text on top of the image:

Card Columns
The .card-columns class creates a masonry-like grid of cards (like pinterest). The layout will automatically adjust as you insert more 
cards.

Note: The cards are displayed vertically on small screens (less than 576px):

Card Deck
The .card-deck class creates a grid of cards that are of equal height and width. The layout will automatically adjust as you insert 
more cards.

Note: The cards are displayed vertically on small screens (less than 576px):

Card Group
The .card-group class is similar to .card-deck. The only difference is that the .card-group class removes left and right margins 
between each card.

Note: The cards are displayed vertically on small screens (less than 576px), WITH top and bottom margin:
